- IasSetupEvent must be generated by Switch Matrix and Routing Zone to provide information about unrecoverable errors in Source or Sink Device.
  Routing Zone knows its linked Sink Device and can put this information into the event. Switch Matrix only knows the MirrorBuffer but not the
  Source Device. It has to get this info somehow in order to prepare the SetupEvent.
- When pulling off an USB sound card the xrunrecovery works although the device is not available anymore. We need to find a more suitable method
  to detect unrecoverable device errors.
