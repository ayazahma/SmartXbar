 * This class is used to create bundle assignments for a stream with a given number of channels.
 * Depending on the number of channels a different vector is used to manage the already created bundles.
 * This is useful to avoid fragmentation when adding a new stream that has to be mapped to already existing
 * but not yet completely filled bundles. That means that we have one bundle vector for mono streams,
 * one bundle vector for stereo streams and one vector for multi-channel streams. By using this simple approach
 * we are sure that two stereo streams will always be mapped into the same bundle regardless on how many mono
 * or multi-channel streams are also created.
